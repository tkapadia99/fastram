# MediaKind

Here I worked as a software developer during my freshman and sophomore year summers as well as part time throughout the school year. I really learned how to manage my time efficiently as a full time student and working 20+ hours a week

## Software Developer

- Headed the MediaRoom effort for the MediaKind Operational Suite (MKOS), an R&D analytics tool supporting multiple products
- Developed code in Springboot to asynchronously fetch data from multiple SQL Servers and store it into an ElasticSearch
- Utilized Apache Echarts and DataTables in an Angular application to display the data
- Wrote complex queries to get specified data for charts on the backend
